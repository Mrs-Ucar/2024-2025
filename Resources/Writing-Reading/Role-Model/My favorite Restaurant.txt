    There are many different restaurants. Some people prefer eating fast food. On the other
hand, some people may prefer to eat some local food like sushi,kebaps,etc. Everybody has a
favorite dish and a favorite restaurant to eat out. Like everybody, I also have a favorite place
to eat out. It is “Urfa Kebaçısı” in Buca. I like this restaurant for many reasons. First of all, the
waiters are very polite and helpful. Secondly, the service is very quick. Morever, this restaurant is not
very expensive. So students and civil servants prefer to eat in this restaurant. In addition, the
customers are generally friendly as well. I do not see rude people in this place. Last but not the least,
if you are a vegetarian, you can eat healthy food such as some vegatable salads. Consequently, this
restaurant is very popular among both vegetarians and kebap lovers. As a result, I recommend you
should also try this restaurant one day.

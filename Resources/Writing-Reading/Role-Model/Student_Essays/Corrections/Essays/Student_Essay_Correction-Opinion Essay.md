                                            Importance of Health
   Some section of society loves taste of food too much. Nevertheless, others be careful about their
halth. From my point of view, health is the most important thing in life. I must admit that, enjoying
from life is another significant thing. However, people ought to make balance between health and
taste. This essay examines place of foods in our lives.

  Firstly, I am going to explain dangerous issues about digestive system. One of disease is diabetes.
People are too unwise about diabetes. They eat unconsciously and then they get sick. Especially,
parents must be careful about their children. Kids love chocolate, sugar, cream and other desserts.
They cannot understand importance of health. So, at this point, parents have some responsibilities.
They should give fruit and vegetables to their kids. In this way, current generation is going to be
healthier. Other disease is obesity. It means being too fat. It cause lot of disease such as heart attack.
As I indicated above, we must change our nutrition.

  Secondly, some people more care health than the others. I am refering sportsman. People who
do sport, prepare a healthy nutrition plan. Although, they do not love some foods they eat. Because,
they know importance of health and they must keep their performance. These foods are necessary
for improvement and recovery. Sport is type of life. So, health is more important than taste for
them. As a sportsman, I agree with them.

  To sum up everything that has been stated so far, health is more significant than taste. For the
good life we need healthy body.

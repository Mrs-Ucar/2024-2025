Drawbacks of Social Media

Nowadays, everyone generally uses a social media app. These apps may be different for everyone, such as Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, etc. However, I think most people are not careful in using these apps. I will write about these examples.

Firstly, we should be careful when reading something because social media has all people's opinions. Some of those may be wrong, missing, or gossip. This opinion may have bad results, so we should carefully research.

Secondly, some content may set a bad example for children. For instance, bad game videos, war and psychological content, wrong information, etc. Parents should be careful about their children's social media use until a certain age.

Consequently, there may be things that we don't want, although all of us love social media. We should be careful about many things along with what I wrote.

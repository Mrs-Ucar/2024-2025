</br>

**1. Talk about your favourite movie.**
   - My favorite movie is "The Lion King." I love the animated characters and the music. It's a story about a young lion, Simba, and his journey to become king. The songs are catchy, and it always makes me feel happy. That is why it is my favorite movie. I also like some thriller type movies. For example, the movie called "The Silence of the Lambs" was lovely and it made you feel unsecure, still you like the feeling.

**2. Talk about a person you find physically attractive.**
   - I find my friend Özge really attractive. She has a great smile and always dresses so nicely. But what I like the most is her kindness. By the way, it's not just about looks, but also about how someone makes you feel. However, she is just my friend. You know what I mean? The reason why I mentioned her is that she is attractive and gorgeous. But of course, saying as a friend, not as a boyfriend, or something like that:).

**3. Talk about a school subject you enjoyed studying in high school.**
   - I really enjoyed studying history in high school. Learning about the past and understanding how it shaped the present fascinated me. I liked imagining how people lived in different times. Besides, I wish I could speak to some important people in history like Ataturk, Fatih Sultan Mehmed or some pioneers in the history.

**4. Talk about an interesting house, apartment, or building you have visited.**
   - Last summer, I visited a lighthouse by the beach. It was tall and had a spiral staircase inside. The view from the top was breathtaking. It felt like being on top of the world. That is the reason why I say it is interesting. Apart from that, I haven't seen many interesting buildings because many buildings in Turkey are similar or not so unique.

**5. Talk about a job that you think is useful to society.**
   - Well, there are many jobs which are useful to society. Genrally speaking, I believe being a nurse is a job that is very useful to society. I know it from my mom. She is a nurse and she works hard and she tries to save people with the doctors. Nurses take care of people when they are sick, and care makes a big difference in the lives of patients.

**6. Talk about your favourite shop.**
   - Everybody has a favorite shop. Some people like some fashion brands and their stores. But since I am a bookworm, which means I am very keen on reading books, my favorite shop is a bookstore called "Kırmızı Kedi." I love spending time there, exploring new books and getting lost in different worlds. You can find this Bookstore in Turkey in big cities, or in some Shopping Malls. The smell of new books and the quiet atmosphere make it a perfect place for me. 

**7. Talk about an electronic device you would like to purchase.**
   - I really want to buy a new camera. I enjoy taking pictures, and having a good camera would help me capture beautiful moments. I'm excited to learn more about photography and improve my skills. Thus, I want to buy a Canon or a Nikon digital camera. I wish they were a bit cheaper, you know what I mean:(

**8. Talk about a time when you had a problem with a piece of electronic equipment.**
   - Once, my computer crashed right before an important presentation. It was so frustrating! I had to quickly find a solution, and luckily, my instructor, Mr Ucar helped me recover my files. Since then, I always back up my important documents. I'll tell you why. Because I learnt my lesson the hard way.

# After Mid-term III, according to Speaking Pacing

9. **Talk about the most common crime in your country.**

- In my country, as far as I know, the most common crime is "Theft". Of course, I do not have any statistics or any data but everyday, we hear theft related news. This shows that there are lots of thieves in my country, unfortunately. It is quite worrying and we need to reduce the rate of crime in our country. In my opinion, I believe the government should take stricter measures to tackle this issue. As I said before, theft is a significant concern in my country, and it affects everyone.

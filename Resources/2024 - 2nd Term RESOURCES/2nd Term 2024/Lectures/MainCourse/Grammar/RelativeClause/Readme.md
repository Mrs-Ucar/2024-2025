# Relative Clause:
## Where or Which?

###
- Remember the rule: if you can put "there" in the sentence and the grammar and the meaning are correct, then use "where." If not, use "which."**

Bu konuyu, hem sınıfta hem de 1.Dönem size hazırladığım şu Worksheette anlatmıştım, eski bilgileri hatırlamak için bakabilirsiniz:

Arkadaşlar derste anlatırken 1.Dönem de aşağıdaki ipucunu söylemiştim, iyi dinleyenler hatırlayacaktır. 
2.Dönemde bu farkı biliyor olmak daha önemli, zira sınavların sorduğu bir fark bu.
Ne zaman "which" ya da "where", hangisini tercih etmeliyiz gibi açıklamayı aşağıya İngilizce olarak yazıyorum.
Sınıfta Türkçe olarak gene anlatırım, konu daha iyi pekişir, bu örnekleri inceleyerek daha iyi fikir sahibi olursunuz.````




**Example:**

I visited the museum ___ had the famous painting.

a) *which*
b) **where**
**Answer:** b) **where**

**Explanation:** You can say "The museum had the famous paintings. I visited there. Therefore, we use **where**."


The city ___ my grandparents live is very peaceful.

a) *which*
b) **where**
**Answer:** b) **where**

You can say "The city **where** my grandparents live is very peaceful." like this:
The city is very beautiful and my grandparents live there. So if we can put "there" and the grammar and meaning are still correct, 
then instead of "which", use **where** in a Relative Clause.
```


The book ___ I borrowed from the library was very interesting.

a) *which*
b) **where**
**Answer:** a) *which*

If you put "there" to check it (to see whether the correct Relative Clause is **where** or *which*?), then you'll notice, "there" seems odd in the sentence, not correct.

Check this: I borrowed the book from the library there and it was interesting. (Sounds weird in meaning. Translate to Turkish and you can "feel" it is a bit weird.



This is the park ___ we had a picnic last summer.

a) *which*
b) **where**
**Answer:** b) **where**

 You can say like this: "This is the park **where** we had a picnic last summer."
OR like this: "This is a park. We had a picnic there last summer."



The school ___ my sister studies is known for its excellent teachers.

a) *which*
b) **where**
**Answer:** b) **where**

You can say "The school **where** my sister studies is known for its excellent teachers."
OR like this: "The school is known for its excellent teachers. And my sister works there."



**To sum up, Remember the rule: if you can put "there" in the sentence and the grammar and meaning are correct, then use "where." If not, use "which."**

#  Question Tags ❓
### Question Tags are easy, aren't they? 😃

You'll be there, _____?

a) won't you  [✅] </br> 
b) wouldn't you [⛔]

- **Correct Option** is **"A"**  > **You'll be there, _won't you?_**

Angela already knew him, _____?

a) knew she   [⛔] </br> 
b) didn't she  [✅] </br> 

- **Correct Option** is **"B"**  > **Angela already knew him, _didn't she?_**

````Question tags are more common in speaking than writing.```` ❗

### We often use question tags when we expect the listener to agree with our statement. In this case, when the statement is positive, we use a negative question tag.

She's a doctor, isn't she? </br>
Yesterday was so much fun, wasn't it? </br>

````- If the statement is negative, we use a positive question tag. ````

He isn't here, is he? </br>
The trains are never on time, are they? </br>
Nobody has called for me, have they? </br>

- If we are sure or almost sure that the listener will confirm that our statement is correct, we say the question tag with a falling intonation. If we are a bit less sure, we say the question tag with a rising intonation.

### Formation
````If there is an auxiliary verb in the statement, we use it to form the question tag.````

## EXAMPLES:


```
- I don't need to finish this today, do I?
- James is working on that, isn't he?
- Your parents have retired, haven't they?
- The phone didn't ring, did it?
- It was raining that day, wasn't it?
- Your mum hadn't met him before, had she?
- You haven't seen this film, have you?
- Your sister lives in Spain, doesn't she?
- He can't drive, can he?
```

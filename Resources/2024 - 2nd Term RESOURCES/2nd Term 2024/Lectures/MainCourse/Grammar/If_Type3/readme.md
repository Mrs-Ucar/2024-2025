**If Clause Type 3** is a conditional sentence that expresses **an unreal situation in the past** and its **hypothetical result in the past**.  </br>
**Structure:** 
- If Clause Type 3 consists of two clauses: the if clause and the main clause .  </br>
- The if clause uses the past perfect tense and the main clause uses the past perfect conditional or the past perfect continuous conditional.
  </br>
### Examples:
- If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.
- If she had not missed the bus, she would not have been late for school.
- If he had taken his medicine, he would not have felt so sick.
- If they had listened to me, they would have avoided trouble.
  
### **Usage:** 
- If Clause Type 3 is used to express regrets, criticisms, or imaginary situations in the past.  </br>
- It is also used to show that a **past action** or situation has a contrary result **in the past**.

## Use Gerunds

1. **After Certain Verbs**:
   - Verbs like *enjoy*, *love*, *hate*, and *practice* are followed by gerunds.
   - Example: "I **enjoy swimming** in the ocean."

2. **After Prepositions**:
   - Gerunds come after prepositions such as *before*, *after*, *by*, and *without*.
   - Example: "She went for a run **before eating** breakfast."

3. **As the Subject or Object of a Sentence**:
   - Gerunds can play the role of the subject or object.
   - Example (Subject): "**Reading books** is my favorite hobby."
   - Example (Object): "She enjoys **dancing**."

## Use Infinitives

1. **After Certain Verbs**:
   - Verbs like *want*, *decide*, *hope*, and *plan* are followed by infinitives.
   - Example: "I **want to travel** the world."

2. **After Many Adjectives**:
   - Adjectives like *difficult*, *easy*, and *important* are followed by infinitives.
   - Example: "Learning a new language can be **challenging**."

3. **To Show Purpose**:
   - Infinitives express the purpose or intention behind an action.

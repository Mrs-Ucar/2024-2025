### In this repo, you can find some Role Model Essays that I wrote for my classes or from reliable resources and some useful worksheet related to Writing and Reading lectures.

- You can also check some of the corrections that I did for my students' essays. **The aim is to learn from our mistakes and encourage peer-correction as well.**

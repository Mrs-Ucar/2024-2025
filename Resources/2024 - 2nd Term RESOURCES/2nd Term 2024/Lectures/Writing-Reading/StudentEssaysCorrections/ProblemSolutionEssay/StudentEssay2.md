The Internet helps us in many matters. We use it every day. To be honest, we cannot do without it. The Internet is a big revolution in our lives. However, it has brought with it big problems even though it has contributed a lot to us. In this article, I will explain these problems and their solutions.

It is important to mention that we do not ignore the problems that the internet creates for us. One of the biggest issues is the way it is used to access inappropriate content. There are many problems today, such as war, theft, murder, and things like that. People share a lot of video, photo, and etc. about these topics. Unfortunately, most of these are wrong or things that everyone should not see. For example, battlefield photos that children should not see are published. This even causes psychological problems. I can write many examples on this subject.

Although there are serious problems connected to the internet, they are not without solutions. One solution could be parental controls. Until a certain age, children should use the internet in a controlled manner. Parents should make time for these checks and should make the necessary adjustments. They can block certain websites. Another solution could be for the government to make agreements with social media owners to prevent the spread of fake news. They can expand their communication networks and provide information more quickly.

In conclusion, the internet can be harmful in the wrong hands. That is why we must be very careful when using it; everyone must do what they need to do.

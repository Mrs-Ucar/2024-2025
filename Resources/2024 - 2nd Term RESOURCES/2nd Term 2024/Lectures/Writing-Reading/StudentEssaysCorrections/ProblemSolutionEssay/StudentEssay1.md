**REDUCTION OF AIR POLLUTION**

   Air pollution is the most dangerous problem in the world. If precaution is not taken, pollution will continue to damage us. 
There are some responsibilities of humans and governments about air pollution. From my perspective, even one person can change something.
In this essay, I am going to explain and examine air pollution problem and its solution. 

  Firstly, the most effective way is the behavior of people. The most important cause of air pollution is human activities. 
People must be more conscious about the usage of perfume, cigarettes, and transportation vehicles. Also, protecting the environment is another thing we can do. 
provide oxygen to the air. I strongly believe that, if plants are not cut, the air becomes more clear, spacious, and healthy.

  Secondly, states must make new rules about air pollution. For instance, most factories release harmful gas from their chimneys. 
Governments must control whether factories use a filter. There ought to be heavy punishments because air pollution causes global warming, another harmful disaster. 
Also, states must encourage people to protect nature and not damage it. Usage of public transport should be decreased instead of using vehicles. Nevertheless, it is not a certain solution. As for as I am concerned, people should use electric vehicles.

  To sum up everything that has been stated so far, air pollution is too dangerous of a disaster in our life. As I mentioned above, we and governments have some responsibilities. 
We can live healthier by obeying the rules and protecting nature.

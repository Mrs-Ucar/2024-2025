Why is immigration increasing in Turkey?
 

Migration is a well-known issue in our age. The reason for this is very simple. There are too many people who migrate. People have various certain reasons to migrate such as war, money, work, health. Immigration is very common in my country, Turkey. Turkey receives a lot of immigration. From my point of view, there are two main reasons why Turkey receives immigration. The first reason is that Turkey is the gateway to Europe. The second reason is finance and investment.

 

The first reason is that Middle Eastern citizens come to Turkey illegally because for them, Turkey is one of the ways to go to Europe, but they think there is an easy way. Especially citizens of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Pakistan. They want to go to Europe to improve their living conditions. But they do this illegally. And they do not know the rules in the places they immigrate to. I think they are dangerous for innocent people. They act illegally wherever they go and even want to implement Sharia. This is very bad.

 

The second reason is investment and finance. Turkey's economy has been deteriorating in recent years. High inflation and the Turkish Lira are a huge problem for the Turkish economy. Therefore, Most Arab investors invest in Turkey. They have been buying things like land and companies from Turkey for a long time. And by investing, they offer their friends, relatives, and people an option to come to Turkey. In this way, only Arab citizens with money come to Turkey and live in wealth. They can even pay money and become Turkish citizens. This is very sad.

 

Shortly, as I have mentioned above, there are various  reasons for migration. Migration itself is not inherently negative, but when it occurs in an uncontrolled or excessive manner, it can lead to adverse outcomes. Additionally, there are individuals who are refugees, and while their plight is understandable, their unregulated immigration may disrupt the social fabric. Therefore, Turkey must prioritize border security and refrain from selling land or granting citizenship to foreigners solely for financial gain, to protect our nation.

                                                   Impact of Seasons on Our Mood

   Our moods and energy levels change a lot in daily life. This change can sometimes even be periodic. There are many reasons for this; nevertheless, we do not know the exact reason for this. </br>
**From my point of view**, people’s moods and energy levels vary depending on the seasons. In this essay, I will do my best to explain the causes and effects of my point. </br>

 </br>
 
   There are many causes, but I will write about a few. **The first cause** is _weather color_. I think every season has a different hue. </br>
_For example,_ while the air is brown and dreary in autumn, everywhere is adorned with vibrant colors in summer. **Most people say that colors affect people’s emotions.** </br>
This is completely right. When the air is gloomy, I feel lethargic. **Another reason is** poems and songs. _For example,_ in sad poems, autumn trees are always mentioned. This topic affects the whole world.

</br>
         
  **Now, I will explain the results of this issue.** Our movements and desires are different in different weather conditions. </br>
For example, when the weather is bad, I cannot do any work, I do not want to go out, and I think about gloomy things. </br>
**On the other hand,** when the air is good and lively, I am active and talkative. I make lots of plans. I approach everything more positively. **There is also some research and data which shows the relationship between our mood and the weather, seasons, etc.** </br>

</br>

   **Consequently, as I have expressed my opinion with my reasons and effects above,** the seasons are especially important for people’s emotions. </br>
_That is why_ **people's energy levels and moods vary depending on the seasons.**

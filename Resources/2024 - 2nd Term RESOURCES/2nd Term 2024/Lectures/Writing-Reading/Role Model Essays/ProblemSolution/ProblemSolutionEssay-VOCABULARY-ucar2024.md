# EXAMPLES in Context:

---

**Problem: High Prices**

Prices keep going up, making it hard for people to afford things they need. This is called **inflation**. It is a serious problem because it means people's money is not enough, and they struggle to buy food, housing, and other basics. This makes life tough for everyone.

**Solution: What We Can Do**

**To fix this,** we **need to** do a few things. _First,_ the government should make rules to stop too much money from being around. This can help keep prices steady. Also, we need to make things more efficient so it doesn't cost as much to make stuff. That means we should invest in things like schools and technology to make everything work better. We also **need to** make it easier for businesses to do their jobs without too many rules. Lastly, we should help out people who are hit hardest by high prices, like giving them help with buying important things.

## In short, **to solve high prices,** we **ought to** **control** how much money is out there, make things **work better**, and help out those who are struggling the most.

## Last but not the least, find a better solution to your problems than this simple solution 😃
